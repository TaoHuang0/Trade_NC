# TradeNC

## Introduction to our website
Sometimes, a student may want to trade used items with other students. However, using normal social media such us Facebook is not efficient and safe. Hence, we came up with the idea of TradeNC, a website that can help NC students to trade their items. Everyone can post their items along with picture, price and contact information so that other students interested in the item could get in touch and setup meetings to deliever the item. We mainly built the project with React. We also used Firestore as our database. Our database will store the information of all the items. Users will use their google account to log in. On the main page, they can view all the items and they know which items are belong to them. They can easily add and delete items on our website.  

## Installation and Using instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local workplace.
2. Using `npm install` in commend line to install all the dependencies for this project. The details of the dependencies are listed below.
3. Using `npm start` to start the program. You will be redirected to our website!
4. Using `control+c` in commend line to stop the program.

P.S: We use `npm start` instead of `npm run`, but they perform the same task. Also, `npm test` is available. You can use this in commend line to test the program.

## Challenges we ran into
We had issues getting image from our database. Special thanks to Pedro Tech from Youtube for the Cloud Storage tutorial!

## What's next for TradeNC
Can be polished and actually put in use among UNC students and even students from nearby universities.
