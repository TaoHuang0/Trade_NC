# TradeNC

## Inspiration
We wanted a platform that allows us to trade used items with other students.

## What it does
Everyone can post their items along with picture, price and contact information so that other students interested in the item could get in touch and setup meetings to deliever the item.

## How we built it
We mainly built the project with React. We also used Firestore as our database. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had issues getting image from our database. Special thanks to Pedro Tech from Youtube for the Cloud Storage tutorial!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Created an app of our own that could actually be in use.

## What we learned
Gained valuable web development skills.

## What's next for TradeNC
Can be polished and actually put in use among UNC students and even students from nearby universities.
